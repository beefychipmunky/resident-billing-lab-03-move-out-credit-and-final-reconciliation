Hands on lab simulating a resident move out scenario involving an overpayment and final account reconciliation using mock billing data.

## Objectives

- Identify overpayments through ledger review  
- Distinguish between payments, credits, and adjustments  
- Apply appropriate balance adjustments at move out  
- Reconcile final account balance to zero  
- Document actions to maintain an audit ready record  

## Discrepancy Identified

- Resident payment exceeded the rent amount, creating an overpayment  
- Ledger reflected a negative balance indicating excess funds on the account  
- Account required proper closeout at move out  

## Resolution
